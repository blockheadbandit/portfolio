# My Portfolio
This project repo is for my portfolio page you can find at www.wiggsworld.uk

## The project
This project was made using react and three.js the site currently features an animated background, responsive design, and links directly to my CV or my email contact.
I have very little experience with web dev/react as my expertise is in software development so this page will not be perfect or as high in quality as the software i make is.
## The domain
The domain wiggsworld.uk is a domain I bought on cloudflare to host game servers with my friends, Wiggs is my childhood nickname and has become a username I am known by online with my music being released as _Wiggs.mp3
for information about me or for my other work see the pages on the site.
